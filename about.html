<h1>About TUG</h1>
<h3>The owner (me)</h3>
<p>You probably have seen "techonedits" in the link or "techon" in trello or github. This is a cringe codename to disguise myself to avoid getting caught. I started TUG myself and was joined by someone else for the google alt account. I am the lead developer of TUG.</p>
  <h3>The devs</h3>
  <p>The devs are me (of course),BlueBayStudios. These are codenames (well this is bluebays known name) To protect our identities</p>
